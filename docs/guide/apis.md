# Interaction with the Deep Search APIs

## Autogenerated API clients

The SDK is also exposing the Swagger/OpenAPI autogenerated sdk clients. They can be used for interaction with all the CPS API endpoints.

For more details, refer to the [autogenerated docs](../apis//public/KnowledgeGraphsApi.md).


### Usage of the Swagger SDK

```python
from deepsearch.cps.client.api import CpsApi
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

# Import of the bare Swagger clients
from deepsearch.cps.apis import public as sw_client


api = CpsApi.from_env()

# Initialize the Swagger client, e.g. the `KnowledgeGraphsApi`
sw_kg_api = sw_client.KnowledgeGraphsApi(api.client.swagger_client)

# ...use the Swagger client directly
```

## Interacting with the API directly via `requests`

Another option is interacting with the CPS API directly using the endpoints. CPS provides a Swagger UI for inspecting all API endpoints (documented with schemas). To access the API documentation please use the following URLs:
- User API: `https://{HOST}/api/cps/user/v1/docs/`
- Public API: `https://{HOST}/api/cps/public/v1/ui/`

For example:
- User API: https://deepsearch-experience.res.ibm.com/api/cps/user/v1/docs/
- Public API: https://deepsearch-experience.res.ibm.com/api/cps/public/v1/ui/


Once find the endpoint for your request, you can use it with this example code.

```python
from deepsearch.cps.client.api import CpsApi


api = CpsApi.from_env()
cps_api_url = api.client.swagger_client.configuration.host

# For example, get list of KGs via the endpoint `/backend/project/{proj_key}/bags`
proj_key = "abc123"
r = api.client.session.get(f"{cps_api_url}/backend/project/{proj_key}/bags")
r.raise_for_status()
print(r.json())
```
